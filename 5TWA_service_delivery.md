How long do we store personal data?We generally delete your data after the purpose has been fulfilled. The exact deletion rules are defined in our regional deletion concepts. Different deletion rules apply depending on the purpose of the processing. Within our deletion concepts we have defined various data classes and assigned rule deletion periods to them. When the retention period is met, the stored data will be deleted accordingly.
Under certain circumstances, any requests for deletion may be opposed by legal retention periods, which prevent us from deleting the stored data for a fixed minimum period of time. In order to comply with these legal requirements, we block the relevant data after the purpose has been fulfilled and thereby guarantee data completeness and data integrity.
With which data processors and why do we share personal data?
We never give your data to unauthorized third parties. However, as part of our work we obtain the services of selected service providers and give them limited and strictly monitored access to some of our data. However, before we forward personal data to these data processors for processing on our behalf, each individual company undergoes an audit. All data recipients must meet the legal data protection requirements and prove their data protection level with appropriate proofs.
In the following we would like to inform you in a transparent and understandable way about all our data recipients with the respective reasons:
Data recipient	Reason

Furthermore, personal data may also be disclosed to external tax consultants, lawyers or auditors if they provide services for which they have been commissioned.
Members of the Delivery Hero SE Group	Within a group it is sometimes necessary to use resources effectively. In this context, we support each other within our Group in optimizing our processes. In addition, we provide joint content and services. This includes, for example, the technical support of systems.
This is a joint controllership within the meaning of Art. 26 GDPR. The employer is fully responsible for fulfilling the data protection requirements together with Delivery Hero SE. Within the framework of joint regulations, both the employer and Delivery Hero SE have agreed that both will guarantee their rights equally.

In these cases we are not only obliged to hand over personal data due to legal obligations, it is of course also in our interest to prevent damage and to enforce our claims and to reject unjustified claims.
